Prerender Rails [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/collectiveip/prerender_rails.png)](https://travis-ci.org/collectiveip/prerender_rails)
=========================== 

Are you using backbone, angular, emberjs, etc, but you're unsure about the SEO implications?

Use this gem to install rails middleware that prerenders a javascript-rendered page using an external service and returns the HTML to the search engine crawler for SEO.

`Note:` Make sure you have more than one webserver thread/process running because the prerender service will make a request to your server to render the HTML.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'prerender_rails'

And in `config/environment/production.rb`, add this line:

```ruby
	config.middleware.use Rack::Prerender
```

## How it works
1. Check to make sure we should show a prerendered page
	1. Check if the request is from a crawler (agent string)
	2. Check to make sure we aren't requesting a resource (js, css, etc...)
	3. (optional) Check to make sure the url is in the whitelist
	4. (optional) Check to make sure the url isn't in the blacklist
2. Make a `GET` request to the [prerender service](https://github.com/collectiveip/prerender)(phantomjs server) for the page's prerendered HTML
3. Return that HTML to the crawler

## Customization

### Whitelist

Whitelist a single url path or multiple url paths. Compares using regex, so be specific when possible. If a whitelist is supplied, only url's containing a whitelist path will be prerendered.
```ruby
config.middleware.use Rack::Prerender, whitelist: '^/search'
```
```ruby
config.middleware.use Rack::Prerender, whitelist: ['/search', '/users/.*/profile']
```

### Blacklist

Blacklist a single url path or multiple url paths. Compares using regex, so be specific when possible. If a blacklist is supplied, all url's will be prerendered except ones containing a blacklist path.
```ruby
config.middleware.use Rack::Prerender, blacklist: '^/search'
```
```ruby
config.middleware.use Rack::Prerender, blacklist: ['/search', '/users/.*/profile']
```

### Using your own prerender service

If you've deployed the prerender service on your own, set the `PRERENDER_SERVICE_URL` environment variable so that this package points there instead. Otherwise, it will default to the service already deployed at `http://prerender.herokuapp.com`

	$ export PRERENDER_SERVICE_URL=<new url>

As alternatie you can pass `prerender_service_url` option while during initialization of middleware

``` ruby
config.middleware.use Rack::Prerender, prerender_service_url: '<new url>'
```

## Testing

If you want to make sure your pages are rendering correctly:

1. Open the Developer Tools in Chrome (Cmd + Atl + J)
2. Click the Settings gear in the bottom right corner.
3. Click "Overrides" on the left side of the settings panel.
4. Check the "User Agent" checkbox.
6. Choose "Other..." from the User Agent dropdown.
7. Type `googlebot` into the input box.
8. Refresh the page (make sure to keep the developer tools open).
